# 🚨CustomAlertController

A simple app with single screen.
We have button to press and custom alert controller to call.

Custom Alert Controller has been made as additional UIViewController and contains custom delete button with activity indicator

When delete button is pressed the buttons on alert screen should be disabled and activity indicator should be called.
